Causality
=========
This package provides utilities and tools to use state-of-the-art 
ML methods for causal inference. 

We also believe explainability of both input data, as well as model output 
to be of crucial importance in causal inference tasks. 
To this end, we provide plotting facilities for inference graphs, 
datasets (e.g. to analyze treatment assignment in detail, as well as explore 
and address potentially limiting class imbalances) and estimators.
